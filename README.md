# Chess Quest
Find all unique configurations of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with dimensions MÃ—N where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. Assume the colour of the piece does not matter, and that there are no pawns among the pieces.

## Info

With caching spending time is decreased almost `40%`. Calculation completion time depends on machine capability, tested results for specified test case as following;

|Machine | Specifications | Calculation Time |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|MacBook Air 10.11.5| 1.4Ghz i5 8GB DDR3| 22 - 25sec.|
|Linux Mint 17.3| 2.4Ghz i7 12GB DDR3| 12 - 14sec.|
## Usage

A little info;

    'K' -> King
    'Q' -> Queen
    'B' -> Bishop
    'N' -> Knight
    'R' -> Rook
